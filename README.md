# Proteck and Attack

My game jam submission for # [Game Dev London x Into Games - GGJ22 - Community Showcase](https://itch.io/jam/game-dev-london-x-into-games-ggj22).  
The game was developed in C#/Unity over 48 hours.  
The jam's theme was *"Duality"*

**Brief:**
A soldier lost behind enemy lines with little chance of survival.

But he finds a shield that he can use to protect himself but also defeat enemies in his path. Moving with the shield is slow but safe, without it the soldier is faster, more agile, and can roll - which way will fare him better?
